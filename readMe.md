I deleted a .js file from my computer on accident. I didn't commit the change and the repository still has the original file on it. I can restore my accidently deleted .js file by using this git command.

git checkout HEAD "this is the name of the file on github"

Check out this link for more ways to recover deleted files and how to restore them.
